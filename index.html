            <h1>Can I register to the system without a referrer?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Yes!</b> You will be assigned under a random superior and can then start building your Matrix.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Possible passive income?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Yes!</b> Because every transaction in registration and upgrade invests 5% to the entire Summit-Ethereum network, which is evenly distributed to all
                the <b>current</b> Summit-Ethereumm members.
                <br>
                <b>Summit Multilevel</b> is arranged in such a way that all participants help each other.
                You can obtain spillovers from your superiors or invites, however, if you want to make a lot of money fast, doing nothing will not work.
                <br>
                To provide a passive income in the future, you need to make some effort to invite people and unlock new levels in direct matrix and multilevel matrix.
                Inviting a few active people in your team, you will be able to earn good money and achieve their goals. How quickly this will happen depends on you.
            </p>
            
            
            <h1>Is my Ethereum stored in the system?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Only your shares of the investment. </b> Your ethereum go directly to the wallet of their receivers minus the <b>5%</b> investment.
            </p>
            
            
            <h1>Why is there a 5% investment?</h1>
            <p>
                Investments are good because Ethereum prices can go <b>high</b>. Even if you withdraw all ETH from your wallet, <b>you will still have something from Summit-Ethereum!</b>
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h1>Can I withdraw my shares?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Yes you can, anytime.</b> But also take note of the <b>gas prices</b> because <b>if gas fees are higher than what you withdraw, your wallet will be charged instead!</b>
            </p>
            
            
            

            
            <h1>How does the Summit Matrices work?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Summit Matrix</b> is a closed system, without deadlines for slots, with a limited number of places and an unlimited number of refresh.
                <br>
                Both Direct &amp; Multilevel matrices have 12 levels. All similar and work in the same way.
                Each level needs to be unlocked (level-1 is automatically unlocked when you join!), requiring twice the unlock price of the previous level. 
                <br>
                In the matrix, the referral link is fixed to the person who invited you. You always follow your superior partner, to each of the slots he activate.
                <br>
                In the <b>Direct Matrix</b>, below you is three places in one line. In the <b>Multilevel Matrix</b>, below you are two lines â€“ 2 places in the first line and 4 places in the second.
                <br>
                <br>
